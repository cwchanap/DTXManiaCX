# Unit Tests Summary - Graphics Management System

## Overview
Created comprehensive unit tests for the graphics management system using xUnit framework. The tests cover the major components and ensure the reliability of the graphics device management enhancement.

## Test Project Setup
- **Project**: `DTXMania.Test`
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0 (matching the main project)
- **Testing Framework**: xUnit 2.9.2
- **Mocking Framework**: Moq 4.20.70
- **Dependencies**: MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL 3.8.*

## Test Quality Features

### âœ… **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Tests cover all major public APIs
- Both positive and negative test cases
- Edge cases and error conditions

### âœ… **Data-Driven Tests**
- Extensive use of `[Theory]` and `[InlineData]` for parameterized tests
- Multiple scenarios tested efficiently

### âœ… **Proper Test Structure**
- Clear Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Descriptive test names following convention
- Proper cleanup with `try-finally` blocks for file operations

### âœ… **Error Handling Tests**
